
        The tmk1553b driver v4.06 for ELCUS MIL-STD-1553B interface cards 
allows to create and use software for such cards in Linux operating system 
(Linux kernel 2.2/2.4/2.6).

        The tmk1553b driver supports up to 8 devices of the following 
types simultaneously: TMK-400, RTMK-400, MTMK-400, TX1-PC (TE1-PC), TX1-MP, 
TX1-104 (TE1-104), TX6-PC (TE6-PC), TX6-104 (TE6-104), TE1-PCI, TE1-PCI2, 
TE6-PCI, TE6-PCI2, TE1-PCI4, TE6-PCI4, TA1-PC, TAM1, TA1-104, TA1-PCI, 
TA1-PCI4, TA1-PCI-32RT. The driver supports up to 8 independent devices. If 
some of installed cards contain more than 1 device, then the number of cards 
will accordingly decrease. In addition, the driver supports up to 23 virtual 
RTs located on a single or several cards able to work in Multiaddress RT mode 
(TE6-PCI, TE6-PCI2, TA1-PCI-32RT).

        TMK-400, RTMK-400, MTMK-400 cards can work in BC (Bus Controller)
or RT (Remote Terminal) modes.
        TX1/TE1 series cards can work in BC, RT or MT (Monitor) modes.
        TX6/TE6 series cards can work in BC, RT or MT modes. Besides, TX6/TE6 
cards can be configured to work as a Multiaddress RT (4 RT devices in a 
single physical device).
        TA1 series card can work in BC, RT or MT modes. This driver release 
does not support combined RT/MT mode and Word Monitor mode. TA1-PCI-23RT card 
can work in Multiaddress RT mode only.

        Driver set contains precompiled drivers for kernels 2.2.16, 2.4.7,
2.4.32, 2.6.16 (64 bits), 2.6.21. You may need to compile the driver yourself 
for using the driver with other kernels. Kernel sources (or kernel headers in 
newer kernels) should be installed to enable you to compile the driver. 
If you are planning to use threads in your program, please use make24t/make26t/
make26ut/make26uut commands (with 't' suffix) to compile the driver. The 
driver with threads support enabled was tested in kernel 2.6 only. We believe 
it should work in kernel 2.4 in the case if threads in kernel 2.4 are built in 
the same way as in kernel 2.6 but it has not been tested. If you use threads 
please take in attention that the driver does not have an active thread 
tracking mechanism. It means that if you want to work with the driver from 
different threads of the same process you may need to provide some kind of 
synchronization for driver calls because most driver functions are bound to 
current device/base/subaddress defined in previous calls. The only function 
which does not require synchronization is tmkwaitevents function. You do not 
need any synchronization on process level but you will not be able to use same 
device in different processes.

        There are two methods to compile the driver. The first method is more 
simple and should be tried at first and if the driver cannot be compiled or 
started then try the second method.

1. In the /source/tmk1553b folder run appropriate command: make22u for 
   kernels 2.2; make24u or make24ut for kernels 2.4; make26uu or make26uut for 
   kernels 2.6. 

1. In the /source/tmk1553b folder run appropriate command: make22 for 
   kernels 2.2; make24 or make24t for kernels 2.4; make26 or make26t for 
   kernels 2.6. 
   Linux kernel sources should be placed in the /usr/src/linux folder for 
   successful driver compilation. If, by any reason, Linux kernel sources 
   are placed in other folder (for example, /usr/src/linux-2.4) you need to 
   create /usr/src/linux yourself by running command like this:
   link /usr/src/linux-2.4 /usr/src/linux
   This command is placed in linkkern24 file.
   You may need to run following commands in kernel 2.6 to be able to compile 
   the driver:
   cd /usr/src/linux
   make mrproper
   make cloneconfig
   make modules_prepare

        The driver is built as a kernel module. The driver can be started by 
running command:

insmod tmk1553b.ko <params>

and the driver can be stopped in Linux kernel 2.2/2.4 by running command:

rmmod tmk1553b.ko

or in Linux kernel 2.6 by running command:

rmmod tmk1553b

        Before this, it is necessary to create appropriate device file in 
/dev folder by running command:

mknod /dev/tmk1553b c N 0

where N - major number, assigned to the driver. You can either choose it 
yourself from free numbers and then define it during mknod and insmod calls, 
or allow the driver to obtain it dynamically and then find the number in the 
/proc/devices file.

This command is placed in mkdev file (assuming N is 254).

        In some kernels 2.6 it is possible to create device file automatically 
by starting the driver with special misc=1 parameter. In such a case the 
driver will register in the 'misc' device subsystem and appropriate device 
file /dev/tmk1553b will be created by the 'misc' driver. In such a case the 
driver will use major number 10 associated with the 'misc' driver and minor 
number will be assigned dynamically by the 'misc' driver. You can find this 
number in the /proc/misc file.

        In the case of any errors at driver start some diagnostic messages can 
be written at the end of the /var/log/messages file.

        You can use expressions below as parameters for the driver:
misc=M - use the 'misc' device to register the driver, where N can be 0 (off) 
        or 1 (on);
nrt=N - define maximum number of virtual RTs on each Multiaddress RT device;
major=N - define major number N for the driver. If the number is not defined
        the driver tries to obtain it dynamically. If nobody else has tried 
        to obtain major number dynamically, its value usually is 254;
name="mydevice" - define device name the driver registers;
        Default: name="tmk1553b";
a0=N - define first I/O registers address of ISA device 0. For most devices 
        except TMK-400 there is the first address only. Address is defined in 
        C/C++ format, i.e. hexadecimal values should have prefix 0x;
b0=N - define second I/O registers address of ISA device 0 (for TMK-400 only).
        Address is defined in C/C++ format, i.e. hexadecimal values should 
        have prefix 0x;
i0=N - define irq number of ISA device 0;
t0="type" - define type of device 0. "type" values can be "TMK400", "RTMK400",
        "TMKMPC", "TMKX", "TMKXI", "TA", "TAI" and they are the same as device 
        types in the tmk.cfg configuration file in DOS;
l0="load" - define load type for TMKX/TMKXI devices. "load" values can be 
        "TX1", "TX6", "MR6". Default: "TX1";
d0=N - define Elcus MIL-STD-1553B PCI card number in computer, starting 
        from 1. The driver use this number to distinguish several PCI cards. 
        Cards numbers depend on cards order in PCI slots. In the case of 
        single Elcus MIL-STD-1553B card only its number is 1;
e0=N - define device number on PCI cards with several devices(TE1-PCI2, 
       TE1-CPCI2, etc.), starting from 1.

a1=N b1=N i1=N d1=N e1=N t1="type" l1="load"
a2=N b2=N i2=N d2=N e2=N t2="type" l2="load"
a3=N b3=N i3=N d3=N e3=N t3="type" l3="load"
a4=N b4=N i4=N d4=N e4=N t4="type" l4="load"
a5=N b5=N i5=N d5=N e5=N t5="type" l5="load"
a6=N b6=N i6=N d6=N e6=N t6="type" l6="load"
a7=N b7=N i7=N d7=N e7=N t7="type" l7="load" - same parameters for devices
        from 1 to 7.

        For ISA devices you need to define parameters a, [b], i, t, [l], for
PCI devices you need to define parameters d, [e], t. Parameters b, e, l can
be defined if necessary for appropriate device types.

        After the driver started, you can work with the driver according
to Driver Programmer's Guide (tmkguide_e.doc) and Driver Reference Guide 
(tmkref_e.doc) which can be downloaded separately as a single archive at 
http://www.elcus.ru/files/mil-std/drv/1553docs_e.zip

        Some programs such as 'simpltst', 'randbcrt' and 'mt1553be' are 
placed in 'bin32' and 'bin64' folders.

        'simpltst' - simple test utility for the driver and one device. It 
performs device memory test and device interrupt generation test.
Usage:
'simpltst'   - performs test of the card 0,
'simpltst 0' - performs test of the card 0,
'simpltst 1' - performs test of the card 1,
etc.

        'randbcrt' - test utility for the driver and two devices (BC and RT) 
or three devices (BC, RT and MT) connected via data bus.
Usage:
'randbcrt [D D [D]] [a] [b] [c+-] [g+-] [i+-] [f+-] [eD] [mD-D]'
Default: 
'randbcrt 0 1 a b c+ g+ i+ f+ e0' - device 0 BC, device 1 RT, buses A and B,
mode commands enabled (c+), broadcast messages enabled (g+), instrumentation
bit enabled (i+), RT flag mode enabled (f+), errors - unlimited (e0).

        'mt1553be' - message monitor program saves message log to the file 
and can display some defined data on the screen.
Usage:
'mt1553be parameters'
Parameters (with default values):
? - this help;
d<DeviceNumber(dec)> - defines device number (starting from 0) (no);
n<FileName> - defines output filename (nmonitor.dat);
l<BufferLength(dec)> - defines messages buffer length (l%ld);
f<WriteWord(hex)> - switches on the specified data word prewrite mode for
     all monitor memory (off);
th<0-6> - switches on hardware message timer (off);
b<+/-> - switches on/off broadcast messages monitoring (b+);
ar<RtAddressRange(dec)> - defines RT addresses range for data registration,
     for example: ar2,5-10,17,28-30 (ar0-30);
o<DataAddressRange(hex)> - defines displayed data addresses range in the bus
     when monitoring, for example: o0E21,5223-5226 (off);
m<b/r/m> - defines modes of buffering(b), registering(r),
     monitoring only(m) (mr).
Examples:
'mt1553be d0 ndata.sav l2000 fFFFF ar0-9,20-29'
'mt1553be d1 th'

        Sources of the driver and 'simpltst', 'randbcrt' programs can be found 
in appropriate subfilders of the 'source' folder.

        In the version v4.00 and above the driver supports TA1-PCI-32RT card 
in Multiaddress RT (up to 31 RT) mode.

        While the numbers for real devices are assigned manually, the numbers 
for virtual RTs located on Multiaddress RT devices are assigned by the driver 
automatically. For virtual RTs the driver assigns numbers 8 and above. The 
'simpltst' program allows to determine the starting number and the quantity of 
virtual RTs located on real Multiaddres RT device if started with parameter 
equal to Multiaddress RT device number.

        Current driver version allows to use up to 23 virtual RTs only because 
of 'tmkwaitevents' function syntax using 32-bit signed parameter as a device 
numbers mask. As far as 8 bits are reserved for real devices, virtual devices 
can use 23 bits only. If it is necessary to use several TA1-PCI-32RT cards 
with total quantity of RTs less than 24, then it is possible to limit quantity 
of RTs on each single card by specifying 'nrt' parameter at driver start. It 
is planned to extend the driver API in some future driver versions to allow it 
to handle more virtual RT devices.
